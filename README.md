This is a fork of guard 2.6.1 that trivially modifies the libnotify notifier
to emit notifications only on failure. I can look at the guard terminal to
check if tests are passed, I only want to see popups when they fail.

For more information on guard, see https://github.com/guard/guard

This fork may or may not receive updates in the future.
